# bkit stats

> [!CAUTION]
> **Purpose:** This repo's workflow statistics, computed from `.bkit/stats.jsonl`, `.bkit/friction.jsonl`, `docs/deferrals.jsonl`. Workflow closes append the rows; rows a direct chat wrote (`utility`) are reported apart.

## Rows

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Kind | Workflow rows | Direct-chat rows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| outcome | 1 | 0 |

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Workflow | Rows |
| --- | --- |
| build | 1 |

## Workflow runs

Rows a workflow close wrote at the end of a design, plan, build, debug or ship run.

### Run durations

No outcome row records a duration.

### Change size vs failures

A run counts as an error when it added failures. Dispatch-size threshold: 1000 lines added.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Lines added | Runs | Errors | Error rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| XS (0–49) | 1 | 0 | 0.0% |

Attempt counters: 0 counted by the shell (trusted), 1 reported by the model (untrusted).

### Agent context peaks

No context data. A close records it from the Claude Code session that ran the workflow.

## Direct chats (`utility`)

Rows a direct chat wrote outside any workflow run (`by.workflow` `utility`). They are never added to the workflow figures.

No outcome or compliance rows from direct chats.

     ✓ local: separates this run's own non-doc file from the unpushed dev work it inherited 323ms
     ✓ PR shape: dev refuses the push → pushes the roadmap commit, then hands PR creation to MCP (80, stage open) without gh 710ms
     ✓ PR shape on a laptop: commits the roadmap row in the worktree holding the branch 737ms
     ✓ PR merge refused: updates the PR branch from dev and merges on the next try 753ms

     ✓ PR merge refused on every try: stops (17) after LAND_ATTEMPTS, PR left open 577ms
     ✓ local: a squash that drops the branch's ledger rows puts them back (no merge=union) 668ms
     ✓ land removes the worktree when only the copied .env is untracked 532ms
     ✓ land keeps the worktree for real leftovers and names only them, not the copied .env 478ms

ok 1 prefers a WORKING sanctioned GH_TOKEN over --with-token login (does not invoke gh auth login) # in 450 ms
ok 2 prefers a WORKING sanctioned GITHUB_TOKEN over --with-token login # in 195 ms
ok 3 falls back to --with-token login from BKIT_GH_TOKEN when neither GH_TOKEN nor GITHUB_TOKEN is set # in 199 ms
ok 4 a PRESENT but non-authenticating GH_TOKEN is diagnosed, not silently trusted (regression) # in 193 ms
ok 5 the placeholder diagnosis does not pretend a --with-token login would help (regression) # in 196 ms
ok 6 the placeholder path still records RUNTIME_GITHUBCLI=false and never hard-stops the session # in 187 ms
ok 7 gh absent from PATH is stated plainly rather than falling through silently # in 68 ms
ok 8 records RUNTIME_GITHUBCLI=true loudly when gh is authed # in 221 ms
ok 9 records RUNTIME_GITHUBCLI=false loudly when gh is not authed # in 188 ms
ok 10 emits the dual-lane WARNING (non-blocking) when RUNTIME_GITHUBCLI=false and no credential env is set at all # in 197 ms
ok 11 does NOT emit the dual-lane WARNING when RUNTIME_GITHUBCLI=false but BKIT_GH_TOKEN is set (MCP lane still viable) # in 192 ms
ok 12 the hook never hard-stops the session (always exits 0) even on the dual-lane warning path # in 198 ms
ok 13 without bkit installed, gh still logs in from BKIT_GH_TOKEN and provisioning is skipped loudly # in 199 ms
ok 14 without jq, gh still logs in from BKIT_GH_TOKEN # in 203 ms
ok 15 runs each context-fetch:provision recipe below bkit:end through bkit context provision # in 933 ms
ok 16 a failing provision recipe is named on stdout for the agent and listed in .bkit/.unavailable # in 508 ms
ok 17 stub: a response script keeps argv and exit status through the stable executable # in 12 ms
ok 18 stub: a missing response script fails instead of using the normal fixtures # in 13 ms
ok 19 stub: the response selector is cleared before running its body # in 12 ms
ok 20 stub: gh api runs?head_sha=green-capstone returns the captured workflow_runs list # in 16 ms
ok 21 stub: gh api runs/<id>/jobs returns the captured jobs list, --paginate is accepted # in 18 ms
ok 22 stub: gh api runs?head_sha=<unknown> returns total_count 0 (CONFLICTING / no-run shape) # in 14 ms
ok 23 stub: BKIT_FAKE_GH_API_ERROR=1 — every api call exits 1 with stderr (code-20 path) # in 12 ms
ok 24 stub: gh api rate_limit returns the requested fixture state (BKIT_FAKE_RATELIMIT_STATE) # in 16 ms
ok 25 stub: non-api argv exits 1 (loud on unmocked boundary, per FAKE_BIN/gh precedent) # in 11 ms
ok 26 stub: BKIT_FAKE_RATELIMITED=1 — run-list query fails with rate-limit stderr BUT rate_limit still answers # in 26 ms
ok 27 stub: --paginate emits one document per page; --slurp collapses them into an array # in 41 ms
ok 28 refresh builds the register from the staged files, not HEAD or unstaged edits # in 536 ms
ok 29 refresh rewrites the README copy of the packages diagram from the new register # in 310 ms
ok 30 refresh drops a file deleted in the index from the build # in 268 ms
ok 31 sets BKIT_ keys, strips quotes and export prefix, records them in a 0600 state file # in 492 ms
ok 32 a key removed from the env file is unset on the next run # in 162 ms
ok 33 an empty value unsets the key instead of setting an empty string # in 137 ms
ok 34 non-BKIT_ keys are skipped # in 135 ms
ok 35 one failing key does not stop the others and the exit status is non-zero # in 151 ms
ok 36 a failed unsetenv is retried on the next run # in 162 ms
ok 37 logs key names only, never values # in 139 ms
ok 38 missing env file exits 0 without calling launchctl # in 23 ms
