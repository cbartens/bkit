     ✓ refuses a resumed design / plan worktree whose branch carries unpushed dev work 1889ms
     ✓ debug: commits a failed ship's leftovers, drops the logs dev already holds, then rebases 2310ms
     ✓ build: commits a failed ship's leftovers, drops the logs dev already holds, then rebases 2138ms
     ✓ keeps a dropped log that differs from dev's copy outside the tree, and removes an identical one 1754ms

     ✓ never commits bkit's own .bkit/.env, even where .gitignore lost its line 2086ms
     ✓ re-links bkit's own .bkit/.env on resume, so a worktree made earlier heals itself 1638ms
